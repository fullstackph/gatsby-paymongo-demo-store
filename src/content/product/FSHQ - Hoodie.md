title: FSHQ - Hoodie
description: Sometimes coding requires working in cold environments. It's often hard to find objects which will help combat that pesky chill. Sure, you could wear fingerless gloves or a sweatervest, but why settle for garments that make you look like you can't afford fingers or sleeves. If only someone would create a body covering with a "hood" type of device to cover your head.
